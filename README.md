# OptiGlonk

OptiGlonk is a fabric mod that optimizes the parts of Minecraft nobody cares about.  
Included optimizations:
* LevelLoadingScreen

**Note: The same LevelLoadingScreen optimization also exists in jellysquid's Lithium mod! I didn't know this at the time of this mod's creation. Go use hers instead**
